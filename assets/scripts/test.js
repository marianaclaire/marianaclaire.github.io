		message:"Working with Mariana was an absolute pleasure! She is the REAL DEAL! Immediately she was able to connect with my spirit guides and angels, giving me detailed descriptions, names, and messages from them that have incredible profound insight on my life at the moment and the major challenges I am facing. She has helped me to find clarity with my life purpose and to see the specific blockages and traumatic wounds that are at the root of my current challenges. I highly recommend Mariana if you are in need of some guidance, healing, and deep spiritual insight! Thank you Mariana, you are a very talented, beautiful lightworker and I am so grateful for your help <3",

		message:"I had a aura drawing and reading done by Mariana and was impressed by the accuracy and detail she puts into her work. She truly touched my soul. I also had my one guide come through and ask to be drawn, I was amazed with how she could draw him exactly how he appears to me, and I'm so grateful I would highly recommend a reading if you want to reconnect with who you really are on a soul level. So much love and care goes into her work.",

		message:"When I first booked a session with Mariana I was so scared and skeptic about the whole thing, I was still very new to this spiritual movement. However, had been mediating for about year and through that I had managed to contact my main spirit guide. Therefore when Mariana spoke to me about my guide, I was able to confirm that she was the real deal and my walls came down. For the rest of the session we spoke about my other guides and my life purpose which brought me into this state of realisation. I like her honesty and the gentle way she approach me cause I was quite nervous. I think she incredibly gifted and would recommend her to all of you who are looking for answers and are to feel empowered. Mariana has a beautiful ability to empower people with her gift, which is what I personally took from the session. Thank you so much Mariana, you're an angel on earth",

She is down to earth and told me things that are very real, things I can work on NOW, no matter what I'm feeling. She made sure I understood WHAT I was hearing, WHY it's important and HOW to use the information. She told me my higher guides names, where they are from and why I am associated with them for expansion. It's refreshing to hear that my problems are NOT complicated, and naming my negative core beliefs reminded me of how manageable ALL of my triggers are. Her voice is very healing. I couldn't believe how OLD she acts. I was astonished by how calm, collected, direct, SINCERE, enthusiastic and positive she was. I think shes like that ALL the time. Also, she does drawings. I didn't get one but you should check this all out. Talk with her if you are interested in receiving guidance.",

I learned about aspects of myself I wasn't previously aware of, and in learning about them, it led me to curiously research these aspects of myself more in depth. I highly recommend booking a session with this incredibly gifted and talented young woman who is far wise beyond her years.

She spoke with my guides, asked their names and told me all about their purpose in my life and their negative imprint. Everything she said vibrated inside me - it really was an eye-opening experience! Even with our 8-hour time zone difference, she found a way to schedule our Skype session and a few days later I\'m still buzzing with butterflies inside me :) Thank you so much Mariana for a wonderful experience that has knocked me way out of my usually safe little mindspace - my heart feels soothed, my body feels more alive and my soul is dancing!',

		message: 'Mariana did a soul drawing for me. What a gorgeous and accurate depiction of the truth of who I am. Water and earth energies are strong for me, so I love all the green and blue she used. The orange also represents my love of beauty and feeling good. As I gaze at the drawing, I feel my energetic field align itself from the centre, from my heart. It feels comforting and powerful in my body. This is a perfect time for me to have something tangible to remind me of who I am, as I step into adulthood and decide how I would like to participate in this world. It reminds me of one of my favourite childhood movies, Thumbelina, the fairy born of a flower who does her best to fit into this world. Her message that accompanied the drawing was simple yet VERY potent for me, at this time. I look forward to watching her intuitive gifts grace this world.',
