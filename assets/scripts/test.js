Finding out my roots gave me a clear understanding of my soul aspects and my aura reading confirmed my spiritual purpose and development. I believe having such a reading is a must for any spritual/non spiritual person who is looking for her direction in life. And I highly recommend Mariana for this reading, because she is a very kind, loving and gifted person with an absolutely professional attitute.',

		message: 'Mariana did a soul drawing for me. What a gorgeous and accurate depiction of the truth of who I am. Water and earth energies are strong for me, so I love all the green and blue she used. The orange also represents my love of beauty and feeling good. As I gaze at the drawing, I feel my energetic field align itself from the centre, from my heart. It feels comforting and powerful in my body. This is a perfect time for me to have something tangible to remind me of who I am, as I step into adulthood and decide how I would like to participate in this world. It reminds me of one of my favourite childhood movies, Thumbelina, the fairy born of a flower who does her best to fit into this world. Her message that accompanied the drawing was simple yet VERY potent for me, at this time. I look forward to watching her intuitive gifts grace this world.',

		message: 'Mariana gave me an intuitive reading this morning. . . I was open to whatever came through and boy did she unwrap my world. She helped me clarify some questions I have had for some time but really didn’t want to face. Funny thing was it had nothing to do with what I asked but she picked up on it anyway. . . And gave me the tools to heal it. She is a shining star and very gifted... she certainly brings final closure to whatever it is you have been trying to determine at the crossroads of life.... thank you again sweet girl... I will update you once it all comes full circle. Hugs',
